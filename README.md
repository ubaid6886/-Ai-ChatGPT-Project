**NEW FLUTTER PROJECT**	
This project creates a mobile application that interacts with a language model (GPT-2) through a Flask API. The Flutter frontend provides a user-friendly interface for sending prompts and displaying generated responses, while the Flask backend handles the AI model processing.



🧠 LLM Flask API
A lightweight Flask-based API that serves a causal language model (GPT-2 by default) for text generation. It allows developers to send prompt text and receive generated responses using a simple HTTP POST request.
